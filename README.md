- Clio, the muse of history, ensures that each commit tells a part of the repository's story.
- Erato, the muse of love poetry, brings passion and care into every line of code.
- Euterpe, the muse of music, guides the rhythm and flow of the code.
- Melpomene, the muse of tragedy, reminds us of the importance of error handling and robustness.
- Polyhymnia, the muse of hymns, encourages the use of comments to explain and give praise to the code.
- Terpsichore, the muse of dance, influences the interaction and coordination between different parts of the code.
- Thalia, the muse of comedy, adds a touch of humor and joy to the coding process.
- Urania, the muse of astronomy, inspires us to aim for the stars and strive for excellence in our code.
